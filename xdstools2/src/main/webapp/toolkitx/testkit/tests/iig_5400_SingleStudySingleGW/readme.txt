Single image, Single GW

<h2>Single image study, single Responding Gateway</h2>

<p>Although the test environment provides for three Responding Imaging
Gateways and multiple Image Document Sources, this test expects a single
image to be returned, from a single Responding Imaging Gateway (A) and a
single Imaging Document Source (A1) behind that gateway.</p>

<p>When the test is run:
<ol>
<li/>The Image Document Consumer simulator (IDC sim) sends a Retrieve Image 
Document Set Request (RAD-69 Request) to the Initiating Imaging Gateway 
system under test (IIG SUT), requesting a single image.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-69 Request and send a
corresponding Cross Community Retrieve Image Document Set Request
(RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging Gateway A simulator
(RIG A sim).
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-75 Request, generating a 
corresponding RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document Source A1 simulator
(IDS A1 sim).
<li/>The IDS A1 sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested image.
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-69 response, generating a RAD-75
response, which will be returned to the IIG SUT.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 response, generating
a RAD-69 response and returning it to the IDC sim.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
image.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 responce generated by
the IIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</ol>
</p>
