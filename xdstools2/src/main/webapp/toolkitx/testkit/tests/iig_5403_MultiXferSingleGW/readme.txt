Multiple Xfer Syntaxes, Single GW

<h2>Multiple Transfer Syntaxes, Single Gateway</h2>

<h3>Purpose / Configuration</h3>
<p>A retrieve request is sent to the  Initiating Imaging Gateway for one
imaging study from Community A.
The request includes two Transfer Syntax UIDs.</p>
<table border="1">
 <tr><td>RIG Home Community ID (A)</td><td>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.70.101</td><tr>
 <tr><td>IDS Repository Unique ID (A1)</td><td>1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.71.101</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Transfer Syntax UID</td>
  <td>
   <ul>
    <li>1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50: JPEG Baseline (Process 1)</li>
    <li>1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70: JPEG lossless</li>
   </ul>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>Test Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li/>The Image Document Consumer simulator (IDC sim) sends a Retrieve Image 
Document Set Request (RAD-69 Request) to the Initiating Imaging Gateway 
system under test (IIG SUT), requesting one imaging study.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-69 Request and send a
corresponding Cross Community Retrieve Image Document Set Request
(RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging Gateway A simulator
(RIG A sim).
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-75 Request, generating a 
corresponding RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document Source A1 simulator
(IDS A1 sim).
<li/>The IDS A1 sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested images.
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-69 response, generating a RAD-75
response, which will be returned to the IIG SUT.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 response, generating
a RAD-69 response and returning it to the IDC sim.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
image.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response generated by
the IIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</ol>
</p>
