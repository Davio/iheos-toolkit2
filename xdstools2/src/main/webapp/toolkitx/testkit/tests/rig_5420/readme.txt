Single Image, Single IDS

<h2>Single Image, Single IDS</h2>

<p>Although the test environment provides for multiple Image Document Sources, 
this test expects a single image to be returned from a single Imaging Document 
Source (ids_e).</p>

<h3>Imaging Document Source: E</h3>
<h3>Purpose / Configuration</h3>
<p>A retrieve request is sent to the Responding Imaging Gateway for a
single imaging study with one image.</p>
<table border="1">
 <tr><td>RIG Home Community ID</td><td>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.70.201</td><tr>
 <tr><td>IDS Repository Unique ID (E)</td><td>1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.71.201.1</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Transfer Syntax UID</td><td>1.2.840.10008.1.2.1</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The Responding Imaging Gateway communicates with Imaging Document Source E and
returns one imaging study with a single image.
</p>
<p>
The test points are:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The Responding Imaging Gateway is able to accept a RAD-75 transaction from an
     Initiating Imaging Gateway simulator, trigger a RAD-69 transaction to the
     Imaging Document Source simulator (E), gather the results and return a proper RAD-75
     response to the Initiating Imaging Gateway simulator.</li>
 <li>The RAD-69 transaction includes all parameters, including the proper Repository Unique ID.</li>
 <li>The retrieved image is encoded with the proper transfer syntax and has proper identifiers (UIDs).</li>
</ul>


<h2>retrieve single image</h2>

<p>When the test is run:
<ol>
<li/>The Initiating Imaging Gateway simulator (IIG sim) sends a Cross Gateway 
Retrieve Image Document Set Request (RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging 
Gateway system under test (RIG SUT), requesting a single image.
<li/>The RIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 Request, generating a 
corresponding RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document Source E simulator
(IDS E sim).
<li/>The IDS A1 sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested image.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-79 response, generating
a RAD-75 response and returning it to the IIG sim.
<li/>The IIG sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
image.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Validate-E SOAP RAD-69 Request from RIG SUT to IDS E simulator</h2>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Correct format of RAD-69 request generated by the RIG SUT to Imaging 
Document Source simulator E, including home community ID, repository unique ID, 
and Transfer Syntax UID(s).
<li/>Correct images requested and correct content.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Validate-R</h2>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 response generated by the RIG SUT.
<li>Correct content including
home community ID, repository unique ID, mime type and status.
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Validate-Img Image documents returned in RAD-75 response generated by the
RIG SUT.</h2>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li/>Returned image(s) match those that were requested.
<li/>Correct image content in DICOM tags:<ul>
<li/>SOPClassUID
<li/>SOPInstanceUID
<li/>PatientID
<li/>PatientBirthDate
<li/>PatientSex
<li/>StudyInstanceUID
<li/>SeriesInstanceUID
</ul>
</ol>
