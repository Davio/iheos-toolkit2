Multi-Image Study, Single GW

<h2>Multi-Image Study, Single Responding Gateway</h2>

<h3>Purpose / Configuration</h3>
<p>A retrieve request is sent to the  Initiating Imaging Gateway for one
imaging study from Community B using one transfer syntax.</p>
<table border="1">
 <tr><td>RIG Home Community ID (B)</td><td>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.70.102</td><tr>
 <tr><td>IDS Repository Unique ID (B1)</td><td>1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.71.102</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Transfer Syntax UID</td><td>1.2.840.10008.1.2.1</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Test Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li/>The Image Document Consumer simulator (IDC sim) sends a Retrieve Image 
Document Set Request (RAD-69 Request) to the Initiating Imaging Gateway 
system under test (IIG SUT), requesting two imaging studies.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-69 Request and send a
corresponding Cross Community Retrieve Image Document Set Request
(RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging Gateway A simulator
(RIG A sim).
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-75 Request, generating a 
corresponding RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document Source A1 simulator
(IDS A1 sim).
<li/>The IDS A1 sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested images.
<li/>The RIG A sim will process the RAD-69 response, generating a RAD-75
response, which will be returned to the IIG SUT.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 response, generating
a RAD-69 response and returning it to the IDC sim.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
images.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response generated by
the IIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</ol>
</p>
