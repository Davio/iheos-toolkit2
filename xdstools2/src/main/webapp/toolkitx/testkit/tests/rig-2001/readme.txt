Single image
Retrieve Image Document Set test
<h2>Single image study, single Imaging Document Source</h2>

<p>Although the test environment provides for three Image Document Sources, this 
test expects a single image to be returned, from a single Imaging Document 
Source (E) behind the Responding Imaging gateway SUT.</p>

<h2>SingleDocumentRetrieve</h2>

<p>When the test is run:
<ol>
<li/>The Initiating Imaging Gateway simulator (IIG sim) sends a Cross Gateway 
Retrieve Image Document Set Request (RAD-75 Request) to the Responding Imaging 
Gateway system under test (RIG SUT), requesting a single image.
<li/>The RIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-75 Request and send a
corresponding Retrieve Image Document Set RAD-69 request to the Imaging Document 
Source E simulator (IDS E sim).
<li/>The IDS E sim will process the RAD-69 request, generating a response
containing the requested image.
<li/>The RIG SUT will process the RAD-69 response, generating a RAD-75
response, which will be returned to the IIG sim.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response and store the received
image.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Validate</h2>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-69 request and RAD-75 response generated by
the RIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-69 request and RAD-75 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</ol>
</p>
