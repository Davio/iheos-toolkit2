Unknown Responding GW, Single GW

<h2>Unknown Responding Gateway, Single Responding Gateway</h2>

<h3>Purpose / Configuration</h3>
<p>A retrieve request is sent to the  Initiating Imaging Gateway for one
imaging study from Community A using one transfer syntax value.</p>
<table border="1">
 <tr><td>RIG Home Community ID (A)</td><td>urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.70.102.999</td><tr>
 <tr><td>IDS Repository Unique ID (A1)</td><td>1.3.6.1.4.1.21367.13.71.102.999</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Transfer Syntax UID</td><td>1.2.840.10008.1.2.1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The homeCommunityId in the RAD-69 request does not represent
a community that is known to the Initiating Imaging Gateway.
</p>

<h3>Test Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li/>The Image Document Consumer simulator (IDC sim) sends a Retrieve Image 
Document Set Request (RAD-69 Request) to the Initiating Imaging Gateway 
system under test (IIG SUT), requesting one imaging study.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected to process the RAD-69 Request.
Given that the Home Community ID in the request does not represent
a known Responding Imaging Gateway, the IIG SUT does not send
a RAD-75 request to any gateways.
<li/>The IIG SUT is expected generate a RAD-69 response that
indicates an error condition and returns the response to
the IDC simulator.
<li/>The IDC sim will process the RAD-69 response.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The following validations are performed:
<ol>
<li>Returned image matches that requested.
<li>Correct format of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response generated by
the IIG SUT.
<li>Correct content of RAD-75 request and RAD-69 response, including
home community ID, repository unique ID, and mime type.
</ol>
</p>
